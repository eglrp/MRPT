1. Introduction
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The MRPT project comprises of libraries and tools aimed to help researchers
in the areas of mobile robots and computer vision in the development of 
efficient implementations with reusability of code as a priority. 
It includes classes for easily managing 3D(6D) geometry, probability density 
functions (pdfs) over many predefined variables (points,landmarks,poses,maps,...),
Bayesian inference (Kalman filters, particle filters), image processing, obstacle
avoidance, etc...

2. Documentation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Further information, the latest downloads, documentation, and tutorials are 
available online at the MRPT website: 
 http://www.mrpt.org/

The complete classes reference can be found at "doc/chm/", or online at:
 http://reference.mrpt.org/

For questions on using or compiling MRPT, write in the help forums:

3. Compiling and installing
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.1 *** FIVE SECONDS INSTRUCTIONS ***

 1) Invoke cmake-gui and select: 
      Where source is          --> MRPT source root directory
	  Where to build binaries  --> Pick a new, empty directory.
	  
   Note: If your platform doesn't support cmake-gui, open a console, 
         chdir to a new empty directory and execute:
		  $ ccmake <PATH_TO_MRPT_SOURCES>

 2) Within cmake-gui (or ccmake), set all the build options as 
    you desire, then press "Configure" and "Generate". To build 
	the examples, enable "BUILD_SAMPLES".
	
 3) Build with the IDE / compiler you selected from CMake (Visual Studio, 
    GNU Make,...)
 

3.2. Further details (RECOMMENDED!)

See the document "doc/COMPILE-INSTALL.html" for instructions on how to compile 
the MRPT C++ library, the samples, applications, and also how to regenerate the 
reference documentation. Probably a more updated version will be found at:
 http://www.mrpt.org/Building_and_Installing_Instructions

 
4. News / Changelog
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The last changes can be found in "doc/NEWS.html". The updated online version, 
generated automatically from SVN comits, can be found at:
