  - Maintainer of vision-related classes (mrpt::vision namespace in libmrpt-core).
  - Visual odometry for stereo images.
  - Work in CLandmarksMap for efficiency of visual SLAM.
  - Many image-related functions.
  - Many functions in mrpt::topography

* Antonio J. Ortiz de Galisteo, University of Malaga (2007).
  - Addition of many mathematical functions.
  - More matrix operations.
  - Quaternion support.
  - Mono SLAM classes and the MonoSLAM demo (the first version).
  - Some classes for hardware interfaces (Sonars, robotic head)
  - Additions to the graphics renderer CMRPTCanvas.
  - The first version of the ro-localization application.

  - The RANSAC and genetic model fitter: mrpt::math::ModelSearch
  - Different improvements and bug fixes.

* Jan Girlich, University of Hamburg.
  - Added mrpt::hwdrivers::CIbeoLuxETH 

*  Emil Khatib, University of Malaga (2011-) 
  - A few new classes to handle WiFi-signal strength receivers and build 
    maps out of such observations: mrpt::slam::CObservationWirelessPower, 
    mrpt::hwdrivers::CWirelessPower and mrpt::slam::CWirelessPowerGridMap2D
    
*  Kasra Khosoussi (K.N.Toosi University, Iran)
  - Patches to improve the JCBB data association implementation.

Several bug reports have been provided from MRPT users world-wide. We kindly thank all of
them for this valuable feedback, and they are usually mentioned in changelogs.
