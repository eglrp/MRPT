(These notes are mostly for myself (J.L. Blanco), but hopefully they'll be 
 useful if someone else maintains MRPT in the future...)

  MRPT release check-list:
=============================

1) CREATE PACKAGES OF SOURCES
> Go to mrpt-src. 
> Update "Build & Install" documentation. 
> bash scripts/build_docs.sh -c
> Do the final "svn ci" before the release.
> bash scripts/prepare_release.sh
> bash scripts/prepare_debian.sh

The packages are in $(HOME)/mrpt_release and $(HOME)/mrpt_debian

Now for windows binary packages:
(see also the script: MRPT/scripts/automated_build_msvc_binary_package.bat)
> Extract mrpt-0.9.3.zip
> Build in Debug all the mrpt-* libs.
> Run cmake again (this is to add the debug libs to the list of files to package!).
> Now build ALL in Release + "make test".
> If all OK: Build package
> Install package, test to build "mrpt_example1" with it.

2) DEBIAN PACKAGE
> Go to mrpt_debian/debian
> Edit changelog and copy it to my SVN.
> Go to mrpt_debian
> debuild -S -sa

3) Try compilation in Debian Unstable
> sudo ARCH=amd64 DIST=sid pbuilder --update
> sudo ARCH=amd64 DIST=sid pbuilder --build  MRPT*.dsc
